Senior Software Developer with 20+ years in the field, working in various sorts of different 
projects across multiple industries. I have a very broad skill set, acting as a software 
developer, software architect, scrum master and in project manager roles over the years.

I am familiar with various programming languages, software tools and frameworks. I used to say that
Java is my _mother language_ and Javascript and Typescript are other good friends. Object-Oriented 
and Functional programming are other allies on this crazy Software World. I am passionate about good
Software Design, and my favourite quote around this is **_The best code is no code at all_**!

The experience over the years (or I should say _mistakes_ / lessons learned ðŸ˜œ) 
has helped me to develop analytical and decision-making skills. Simple solutions yet robust are
often the best ones. These are my guidelines.
